We're excited to introduce the first-ever working web-based time machine! Our goal is to let you travel into the future, but there are some limitations you need to know.

Because of the way technology works right now and the things we can't change about how time works, our time machine can only take you into the future, not the past. Also, you won't be able to go very far into the future. We hope to expand on the functionality in the near future as we learn more about the effects of time travel.
